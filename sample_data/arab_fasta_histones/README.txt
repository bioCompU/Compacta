Reads. 3 samples of Paired-end reads simulated from selected histone genes of Arabidopsis.

arabidopsisHistones.fa. Fasta file with the nucleotide sequence of 41 histone genes of Arabidopsis,this file is used as reference.

bam_files. Three bam files result of mapping the reads (from the Reads folder) to the reference (arabidopsisHistones.fa) using bowtie2.

compacta_files. This set of comed and comtr files are the output of using the -p true option in Compacta, they store the preprocessed data (from the bam files), in an easy and quick to load format.

We have covered most of Compacta's input options, depending on what you want to do you could either go from mapping the read to the reference to produce bam files or use the included bam files or preprocessed files, note that Compacta's output may vary depending on alignment algorithm and parameters, we recommend using a strict policy (like '--very-sensitive --score-min L,-0.1,-0.1â€™ on bowtie2), and reporting multi-mapping reads as they are used by Compacta to cluster contigs together.

If you want to try compacta using the provided bam files, then you should do it like this:
<path to compacta>/Compacta -n 3 -s sample_1,sample_2,sample_3 -b arab_histone_sample1.bam,arab_histone_sample2.bam,arab_histone_sample3.bam -o arab_histone_test

If you want to try using Compacta's preprocessed files then you can do it like this:

<path to compacta>/Compacta -n 3 -s sample_1,sample_2,sample_3 -c arabHistones -o arab_histone_test

Both options should produce three files with suffix _clusters.txt,_counts.txt and _status.txt.
_clusters.txt contains the contig-cluster mapping; a 1 if the contig is representative of its cluster or a 0 otherwise; a description of the status of each contig: ZE (Zero evidence) when the contig has no reads mapping to it, SC (Singleton contig) when the contig doesnt share reads with another contig; SL (Singleton by Low Evidence) contigs with few reads that were disconnected from others because of its reduced evidence; NC Contigs clustered with at least another contig; the length of the contig and the number of reads mapped to the contig.
_counts.txt contains the raw counts for each cluster and each sample.
_preclusters.txt contains the definition of the preclusters calculated by Compacta before running the clustering algorithm.
